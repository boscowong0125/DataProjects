1. Quantitative Analysis of Stocks and Strategy Backtesting (*Data Analysis*)
  
    - Dataset: /
    - Hedge funds and investment management companies are putting lots of effort and money into predicting the stock market every day so that they can financially benefit from it. While there are traditional investors like Warren Buffett focusing on calculating the underlying value of companies, there are also investors leveraging technical analysis that solely focuses on the transaction price and volume of assets. Thanks to advancements in big data technology in recent decades, investors are even trying to solve the market using computer algorithms and machine learning techniques. Whichever approach an investor may take, the ultimate goals are to make informed investment decisions and try to capture some profit from the market. To facilitate the technical analysis, we want to develop technical indicators that generate trading signals and backtest some trading strategies conveniently. Ultimately, we want to know whether the strategies are better than simply buy and hold method.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis on Housing Price (*Data Analysis*)
  
    - Dataset: kc_house_data.csv
    - Nowadays, the cost of living becomes higher and higher under inflation. This affects one of the most important aspect of our daily lives - housing, as the home prices are rising much faster than income growth. Especially for a fresh graduate like me, owning a house in developed countries seems too distant because it is foreseeable that I need to spend a huge chunk of money on mortgages for future 25 to 30 years. Yet, it is always good to have a glimpse at the housing market and discover how houses are priced.

3. Company Bankruptcy Detection Model (*Data Science - Classification*)

    - Dataset: bankruptcy_data.csv
    - In banking and finance field, effective bankruptcy prediction is a very important task since corporate finance is one of the major sources of income of commercial and investment banks. On one hand, the banks want to avoid the default risk of borrowers; on the other hand, they want to earn as much interest as possible by lending money to companies. This dilemma cannot be resolved easily as no one can predict the future and make perfect decisions. In this project, we try to implement supervised learning models to make effective bankruptcy prediction and hopefully we could provide insights into making lending decisions.
