1. Exploratory Data Analysis on Stock Price (*Data Analysis*)
  
    - Dataset: /
    - Hedge funds, investment management companies, and many other financial institutions are putting in lots of effort and money every year, trying to predict the stock market so that they could financially benefit from it. While there are traditional investors like Warren Buffett sticking to fundamental analysis and focusing on the valuation of companies, there are also investors standing on the other side and leveraging technical analysis, which focuses on speculating the ups and downs of the market. Thanks to advancements in big data technology in recent decades, speculators are even trying to solve the market by using computer algorithms and machine learning techniques. To have a peek into the world of quantitative finance, we will explore the stock market data in this project and hopefully, we could get some insights into the field through the lens of mathematics and computers.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis on Housing Price (*Data Analysis*)
  
    - Dataset: kc_house_data.csv
    - Nowadays, the cost of living becomes higher and higher under inflation. This affects one of the most important aspect of our daily lives - housing, as the home prices are rising much faster than income growth. Especially for a fresh graduate like me, owning a house in developed countries seems too distant because it is foreseeable that I need to spend a huge chunk of money on mortgages for future 25 to 30 years. Yet, it is always good to have a glimpse at the housing market and discover how houses are priced.

3. Company Bankruptcy Detection Model (*Data Science - Classification*)

    - Dataset: bankruptcy_data.csv
    - In banking and finance field, effective bankruptcy prediction is a very important task since corporate finance is one of the major sources of income of commercial and investment banks. On one hand, the banks want to avoid the default risk of borrowers; on the other hand, they want to earn as much interest as possible by lending money to companies. This dilemma cannot be resolved easily as no one can predict the future and make perfect decisions. In this project, we try to implement supervised learning models to make effective bankruptcy prediction and hopefully we could provide insights into making lending decisions.
    - Skills: Python, PCA, SMOTE, SGD, XGBoost, SVM, Isolation Forest, Grid Search, Confusion Matrix
